# Handlers Configurations
Handlers handle incoming and outgoing messages, including performing additional processing as necessary. 

Handler configurations should point to the handler source code they reference ,
"handler_source"


Handlers should have:

An init function, which takes in relevant:
config dict
send address dict
receive address dict
message config dict 

one or more processing functions, which take in message type and a list of messages
and return a list of messages
